# Screen-Simulator
simulates a small screen in the console where the user may manipulate each individual "pixel"

Currently, the "screen" is set up to move an "on" pixel to the right at 15 frames per second while all other pixels are "off". 
This gives a simple animation of the "on" pixel traveling through a field of "off" pixels. 
However, the  "screen" can be manipulated in an infinite amount of ways.
In the future, I would like to create matrices of frames and feed it to the program to create detailed animations
